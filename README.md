# Note-Taker

## Requirements

* Create an application that displays notes and allows a user to add additional notes
* Create a database in MYSQL and use Express to route to the table information via API's 
* Make calls via AJAX to the API that pull current table info and modify existing data

## Technologies Used

* Node.js
* Javascript
* Express
* MYSQL


## Brief Explanation

Routes for the API's and for the HTML were established. The requests for MYSQL are passed in queries that indicate what method will be employed and how they should modify the table data. From there, the user is able to keep a running tally of notes and add new ones as they please.

## Future Implementation

A delete method will be added that allows the user to delete individual ID's in the table.
